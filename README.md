# Dimensional-Data-Modeling


Worked with the actor_films dataset. Constructed a series of SQL queries and table definitions that will allow us to model the actor_films dataset in a way that facilitates efficient analysis. This involves creating new tables, defining data types, and writing queries to populate these tables with data from the actor_films dataset

The actor_films dataset contains the following fields:

**actor**: The name of the actor. <br/>
